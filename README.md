## Project Description

The **Mango Leaf Disease Detector** is a web application designed to assist farmers and agriculturists in diagnosing diseases in mango leaves using machine learning. The model predicts several common mango leaf diseases, including Anthracnose, Cutting Weevil, Die Back, Powdery Mildew, and identifies healthy leaves. The goal is to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to identify mango leaf diseases, along with the symptoms, causes, and prevention methods for each disease.

The trained model uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and is built for optimal accuracy and performance. The current model file (`mangodisease.h5`) is 97 MB and can classify images of mango leaves into specific disease categories.

## Features

- **Disease Detection:** Identifies diseases such as Anthracnose, Cutting Weevil, Die Back, Powdery Mildew, and healthy leaves.
- **Prevention Methods:** Provides details on prevention strategies for each disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple image upload page with enhanced visuals, including funny quotes for a friendly experience.

## Libraries and Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning/Deep Learning:**
  - TensorFlow (Keras, MobileNetV2, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, etc.)
  - scikit-learn
- **Data Handling & Visualization:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Image Processing:**
  - OpenCV
  - Pillow
- **Web Technologies:**
  - HTML/CSS (for web app design)
  - Flask (for web framework)

## Dataset

The model was trained on a curated dataset of mango leaves, each labeled with their corresponding disease. The dataset includes both healthy leaves and leaves affected by diseases such as:
- **Anthracnose**
- **Cutting Weevil**
- **Die Back**
- **Powdery Mildew**
- **Healthy**

Images were pre-processed, resized, and augmented using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` to improve the modelâ€™s robustness.

## Model Performance

The model has been trained and tested on a dataset of mango leaf images. The architecture is based on **MobileNetV2**, which has been fine-tuned to classify diseases in mango leaves with a high level of accuracy.
